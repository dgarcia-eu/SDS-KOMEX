# What is the aim of Social Data Science?

> The aim of Social Data Science is   
**the Quantitative Understanding of Human Behavior**.  

- **Quantitative:** As opposed to qualitative or descriptive, we aim for robust findings grounded in strong evidence that can be quantified.  

- **Understanding:** Not just predicting, we want to be able to generalize and combine knowledge, and even to motivate interventions or policies.  

- **Human:**  We will not study particles or objects. Measurement validity and ethics will be a challenge.  

- **Behavior:** Observable changes, structures, dynamics, and patterns; not just stories or theories

---
#  How are we going to do it?
**Retrieving, processing, analyzing, and interpreting digital trace data.**

# What is data?

> **Data:** Facts in the form of stored and transmittable information.  

- *Data* is the plural of the Latin word *datum*. *Data* means ”given (things)”.  
- Data is given to us, it is not fabricated nor simulated.

# Why digital traces?

Data from digital traces have six properties that can complement other traditional data sources in the social sciences:

- **Big Data:** Observing large amounts of humans across demographics  

- **Fast Data:** Quantifying aspects of human behavior in real time  

- **Long Data:** Retrieving longitudinal data and at various timescales  

- **Deep Data:** Gathering persistent information on individuals  

- **Mixed Data:** Combining heterogeneous datasources and unstructured data  

- **Strange Data:** Locating small subcommunities or deviant behavior  

---

# What are the limitations of digital traces?

With the great potential of digital traces, aslo come great challenges:

- **Platform biases:** caused by their design, algorithms, social bots, etc

- **Data gatekeepers:** Not everyone can access some data sources

- **Performative behavior:** Talking online is not the same than offline.

- **Representativity issues:** Not everyone leaves digital traces. 

- **Observational data:** Testing causal mechanisms is not straightforward. 

- **The data deluge:** Too much data enables black-box predictions that can be useful but limit our understanding.

# Google Trends

Google Trends is a website hosted by Google that allows you to get a measurement of Google search volume for a term

## Nowcasting flu incidence with Google Trends

<div style="float:right">
<img src="GoogleFluTrends.jpg" width="500px"/>  
</div>

**Nowcasting** is predicting the present. It provides an estimation of the value of a quantity based on signals that appear at the same time. 

Google Flu Trends aimed at nowcasting influenza-related physician visits based on Google search volumes. 

As reported in the [Nature paper](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v457/n7232/full/nature07634.html), Google Flu Trends achieved a high weekly accuracy between 2003 and 2008.

The figure shows the nowcasting result of Google flu trends. CDC data is published with a delay of two weeks.

## When Google Flu Trends Stopped working

![](FluFail-crop.jpg)
During the flu season of 2012/2013 Google Flu trends started overestimating the number of cases.

# Big Data Hubris

.center[![:scale 60%](Hubris.png)]

Google Flu Trends is an example of **Big Data Hubris**: ”The often implicit assumption that big data are a substitute for, rather than a supplement to, traditional data collection and analysis” [(Lazer et al, Science, 2014)](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/343/6176/1203)

> Take home message: **All data is better than Big Data**

## Long-term orientation and economic development
> **Long-Term Orientation (Geert Hofstede)**  
Long-term oriented societies believe that the most important events in life will occur in the future; short-term oriented societies believe that those events occurred in the past or take place now.

## Measuring the Future Orientation Index

[Pres et al. 2012](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep00350) proposed a way to measure how much a society looks towards the future with Google Trends, the Future Orientation Index (FOI). The FOI for a country *c* on year *y* is calculated as:  

.center[
$FOI_{c,y} = \frac{G(y+1,y,c)}{G(y-1,y,c)}$
]

where $G(y_1,y_2,c)$ is the Google Trends volume for searches for year $y_1$ during year $y_2$ from country $c$. 

The FOI measures the ratio of search volume from a country for next year divided by the search volume for the previous year in the same country.
