# Modelling social resilience online

Social resilience can be modelled as a process of how users stay active or inactive in a social networking site. 

If we consider social network users as rational, they will respond to incentives to stay active or to abandon social networks depending on **benefits and costs**.

**Benefits** can be quantified through the content users receive from their friends (shares, comments) and through the attention and support given by their friends (likes, votes).

A simple way to model monotonic benefits is proportionally to the active friends of a user $k_u$:

$$benefit_u = b * k_u$$

# Costs of using an online social network

<div style="float:right">
<img src="Figures/user3.jpg" alt="table flip." width=300pt/>
</div>
**Costs:** Using social network is not only benefits, there are also costs associated with being active.   
--

For example:
- Time spent to learn to use the interface of the platform  
- Risks of disclosing personal information  
- Opportunity costs: you could be doing something else  
- Economic costs, for example membership fees.

A common assumption about costs is that they are relatively similar for all users, thus modeling them as a constant $c$. Then, a user will become inactive when the total benefits are below the cost:

$$ b *k_u < c $$

# The k-core decomposition

The graph remaining after the cascade above is what is called a k-core

> **k-core**: A k-core of a graph $G$ is a maximal connected subgraph of $G$ in which all vertices have degree at least k.

For any network, you can calculate its k-core decomposition as follows:  

- Start with $k_s=1$  
- Remove all nodes with degree less than or equal to $k_s$ and their links  
- Repeat until all nodes have degree larger than $k_s$  
- Increase $k_s$ by one and repeat until no nodes are left

The nodes and the edges removed for certain of $k_s=k$ is called the **k-shell**.  
A **k-core** is the set of all k-shells with $k_s \geq k$.

---

# Coreness centrality

.center[![:scale 27%](Figures/kcore_total.png)![:scale 72%](Figures/kcore_shells.png)]

The k-shell number of a node is also called **coreness centrality**.

# Coreness and social resilience

The cost to benefit ratio $c/b$ defines a critical value of the degree $K$, below which users with degree $k_u<K$ will leave the social network. The remaining active social network is the k-core corresponding to $K$. The **cumulative density function** of coreness values in the network serves as a **resilience function**:

# Stretching the Google trends method

Data scientists at Facebook [replied to the Arxiv paper](https://www.facebook.com/notes/mike-develin/debunking-princeton/10151947421191849/) showing the problem with measuring social network use levels using Google Trends data. Applying the same methodology, Facebook researchers reached the conclusion that Princeton would lose 80% of its students by 2021:

# Stretching the Google trends method

You can even apply it to air and come to the conclusion that the atmosphere will run out of air by 2060:

# Google trends for Facebook

The Facebook examples show that decrease in search volume is a decrease in information searching about the social network, not a decrease in access and use.

# Google trends for Twitter

Twitter is not living a second growth, in fact it's growth has been rather slow to stagnant for a few years, even though it appears it is gaining users after Trump's permanent suspension.

# Temporal validity issues

</br>
A more accurate way to measure activity in a social network is Bruno Ribeiro's [approach using Alexa data](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2566486.2567984), but Alexa focuses on website visits without considering access through mobile apps. 


</br>
Measurement is always an important issue in Computational Social Systems, and just because a paper used a measurement method few years ago, it does not mean it is valid today.

# Triadic closure


<div style="float:right">

</div>

>  **Triadic closure:** The tendency of individuals in social networks to create links to neighbors at distance 2

**Local clustering coefficient**:

$$C_i = \frac{2*t(i)}{d_i *(d_iâˆ’1)}$$

- $d_{out}(i)$ is the outdegree of $i$ (>1) 
- $t(i)$ is the number of pairs of neighbors of $i$ that are connected
- can be averaged or computed globally

# The strength of weak ties

<div style="float:right">
<img src="strongTie.png" alt="A strong tie." width=400pt/>
</div>

**Strong ties:** People who are very close to you (family, friends, etc.)
- Provide reciprocal emotional support
- Long-lasting, require energy and time

**Weak ties:** People you know but not very close to you (colleagues from work, school, etc.)
- Provide information, for example about employment and housing
- Are also faster to disappear

> **The strength of weak ties:** Weak ties are weaker than strong ties, but are also many more than strong ties. (Mark Granovetter)

## When holes are bridged: The small world concept

Small world networks have the following three properties:  
- Most nodes are not neighbors (sparse network)  
- The mean distance between two nodes is small  
- They have high global clustering coefficient

<div style="float:right">
<img src="map_us.png" alt="Milgram's experiment." width=400pt/>
</div>


**Stanley Milgram's experiment:**

- 160 people in Omaha try to reach one person in Boston by mail to their acquitances
- 44 letters reached the target with six steps on average
- Short path length as evidence of small-world
- Average path length on Facebook is 4.5

## Measuring community structure: Q-modularity

The measure of [**modularity**](https://www.pnas.org/content/103/23/8577.short) quantifies the tendency of a network to be divided in densely connected subgroups that are sparsely connected across groups.   
**Q-modularity** measures this tendency:

$$Q = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{u,v} [ A_{u,v} - \frac{k_u k_v}{2m} ]\delta(c_u, c_v)$$
- $u$ and $v$ are two nodes of the network. The sum goes over all pairs of nodes.
- $m$ is the number of edges  
- $A$ is the adjacency matrix ($A_{u,v} = 1$ if and only if u and v are connected)  
- $k_u$ and $k_v$ are the degrees of $u$ and $v$  
- $c_u$ is the community of $u$ and $c_v$ is the community of $v$  
- $Î´(c_u,c_v)$ takes value $1$ if and only if u and v are in the same community, otherwise it's $0$

> **Assortativity:** A network property by which similar nodes are more likely to be connected than dissimilar nodes

---

# Measuring Assortativity

Similarity is based on some node property, e.g. degree, age, political orientation, gender... 
Can be measured with the **assortativity coefficient**:

\begin{equation*}
r=\frac{\sum_c e_{cc}-\sum_c a_c b_c}{1-\sum_c a_c b_c}
\end{equation*}

- $c$ are the classes of nodes
- $e_{cd}$ is the **fraction of all edges** connecting nodes of class $c$ with nodes of class $d$
- $e_{cc}$ is the fraction of all edges connecting two nodes of class $c$
- $a_c=\sum_d e_{cd}$, and $b_c=\sum_d e_{dc}$ (endpoint class fractions)

# Null models

Once we have measured something or got a statistical result from our analysis, we might ask ourselves: What is the probability that this result can appear due to chance alone? 

![](Coins.png)

- If the coin is fair: P(H) = 1/2 and P(HHHHH) = 1/32
- In the case of getting five heads, how plausible is that the coin is fair?

# Permutation tests

- Example: correlation coefficient between two variables $X$ and $Y$: $\rho(X,Y)$
- What is the probability that we could measure a similar or even stronger correlation if $X$ and $Y$ were completely independent?
- We can answer this questions with a permutation test 
- A permutation test has four components:

1. A **test statistic**,  e.g. $\rho(X,Y)$
2. A **null hypothesis**, which is a statement about the value of our test statistic when "nothing interesting happens". 
  - It is often denoted as $H_0$ and in this case it would be $H_0: \rho(X,Y)=0$.

---
# Permutation tests

2. A **null hypothesis**, which is a statement about the value of our test statistic when "nothing interesting happens". 
  - It is often denoted as $H_0$ and in this case it would be $H_0: \rho(X,Y)=0$.
3. An **alternative hypothesis**, which is another statement about the value of the test statistic that stems from our theory or research question. It is often denoted as $H_1$ and, for example, it could be $H_1: \rho(X,Y)>0$. 
  - The alternative hypothesis and the null hypothesis have to be contradictory. Both can't be true at the same time, but both could be false.
4. A **permutation set** with $N$ random permutations or shuffles of the data. Permutations in this set model a world in which the null hypothesis is true and any measurement different than the one specified in the null hypothesis is due to chance alone.

# The p-value of a permutation test

The p-value is a way to summarize the results of a permutation test. 

> **p-value:** Given that the null hypothesis is true, the p-value is the probability that we measure a statistic at least as extreme as the observed result

- **A common misconception is that the p-value measures the probability that the null hypothesis is true**. 

- The p-value measures the plausibility of what we measure under the null hypothesis, which is very different. 
---

# Calculating a p-value 

- *one-sided p-value*: proportion of permutations with a value of the statistic at least as large as the observed one. 
- *two-sided p-value*: proportion of permutations with an absolute value of the statistic at least as large as the observed one.


We can calculate the one-sided p-value from the permutation test:
```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
p_value_Cor = (sum(corPerm>=corObserved)+1)/length(corPerm)
```
 
- We add one to the numerator to ensure we don't say zero
- The result is "significant" (p<0.05), but careful interpreting that word!
- How many times to permute: $10000$ times is safe for (p<0.05)
