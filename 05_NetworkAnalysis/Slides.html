# Why do online social networks collapse?
&gt; **Social Resilience:** The ability of a community to withstand external stresses, disturbances, and environmental changes

# The rise and fall of MySpace

**MySpace** went from being valued more than 12 Billion USD in 2008 to be bought by [Justin Timberlake for 35 Million USD](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/jun/30/myspace-internet).

# The rise and fall of Orkut

**Orkut** was the first attempt of Google to launch an online social network. It was very popular in some countries but lost users to Facebook and it was eventually taken offline.

# Modelling social resilience online

Social resilience can be modelled as a process of how users stay active or inactive in a social networking site. 

If we consider social network users as rational, they will respond to incentives to stay active or to abandon social networks depending on **benefits and costs**.

**Benefits** can be quantified through the content users receive from their friends (shares, comments) and through the attention and support given by their friends (likes, votes).

A simple way to model monotonic benefits is proportionally to the active friends of a user `\(k_u\)`:

`$$benefit_u = b * k_u$$`

# Costs of using an online social network

&lt;div style="float:right"&gt;
&lt;img src="Figures/user3.jpg" alt="table flip." width=300pt/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
**Costs:** Using social network is not only benefits, there are also costs associated with being active.   
--

For example:
- Time spent to learn to use the interface of the platform  
- Risks of disclosing personal information  
- Opportunity costs: you could be doing something else  
- Economic costs, for example membership fees.

A common assumption about costs is that they are relatively similar for all users, thus modeling them as a constant `\(c\)`. Then, a user will become inactive when the total benefits are below the cost:

$$ b *k_u &lt; c $$

# The k-core decomposition

The graph remaining after the cascade above is what is called a k-core

&gt; **k-core**: A k-core of a graph `\(G\)` is a maximal connected subgraph of `\(G\)` in which all vertices have degree at least k.

For any network, you can calculate its k-core decomposition as follows:  

- Start with `\(k_s=1\)`  
- Remove all nodes with degree less than or equal to `\(k_s\)` and their links  
- Repeat until all nodes have degree larger than `\(k_s\)`  
- Increase `\(k_s\)` by one and repeat until no nodes are left

The nodes and the edges removed for certain of `\(k_s=k\)` is called the **k-shell**.  
A **k-core** is the set of all k-shells with `\(k_s \geq k\)`.

---

# Coreness centrality

.center[![:scale 27%](Figures/kcore_total.png)![:scale 72%](Figures/kcore_shells.png)]

The k-shell number of a node is also called **coreness centrality**.

# Coreness and social resilience

The cost to benefit ratio `\(c/b\)` defines a critical value of the degree `\(K\)`, below which users with degree `\(k_u&lt;K\)` will leave the social network. The remaining active social network is the k-core corresponding to `\(K\)`. The **cumulative density function** of coreness values in the network serves as a **resilience function**:

# Stretching the Google trends method

Data scientists at Facebook [replied to the Arxiv paper](https://www.facebook.com/notes/mike-develin/debunking-princeton/10151947421191849/) showing the problem with measuring social network use levels using Google Trends data. Applying the same methodology, Facebook researchers reached the conclusion that Princeton would lose 80% of its students by 2021:

# Stretching the Google trends method

You can even apply it to air and come to the conclusion that the atmosphere will run out of air by 2060:

![](Figures/airQueries.png)

---

# Google trends for Facebook

The Facebook examples show that decrease in search volume is a decrease in information searching about the social network, not a decrease in access and use.

![](Figures/FacebookGT.png)


---

# Google trends for Twitter

Twitter is not living a second growth, in fact it's growth has been rather slow to stagnant for a few years, even though it appears it is gaining users after Trump's permanent suspension.

![](Figures/TwittterGT.png)


---

# Temporal validity issues

&lt;/br&gt;
A more accurate way to measure activity in a social network is Bruno Ribeiro's [approach using Alexa data](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2566486.2567984), but Alexa focuses on website visits without considering access through mobile apps. 


&lt;/br&gt;
Measurement is always an important issue in Computational Social Systems, and just because a paper used a measurement method few years ago, it does not mean it is valid today.

&lt;/br&gt;
&gt; **Take home message:** Your measures based on today's digital traces might not work on tomorrow's

# Triadic closure


&lt;div style="float:right"&gt;
&lt;img src="closedTriad.png" alt="A strong tie." width=500pt/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&gt;  **Triadic closure:** The tendency of individuals in social networks to create links to neighbors at distance 2

**Local clustering coefficient**:

`$$C_i = \frac{2*t(i)}{d_i *(d_i−1)}$$`

- `\(d_{out}(i)\)` is the outdegree of `\(i\)` (&gt;1) 
- `\(t(i)\)` is the number of pairs of neighbors of `\(i\)` that are connected
- can be averaged or computed globally

---

# The strength of weak ties

&lt;div style="float:right"&gt;
&lt;img src="strongTie.png" alt="A strong tie." width=400pt/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

**Strong ties:** People who are very close to you (family, friends, etc.)
- Provide reciprocal emotional support
- Long-lasting, require energy and time

**Weak ties:** People you know but not very close to you (colleagues from work, school, etc.)
- Provide information, for example about employment and housing
- Are also faster to disappear

&gt; **The strength of weak ties:** Weak ties are weaker than strong ties, but are also many more than strong ties. (Mark Granovetter)

# Structural holes and communities

.center[![:scale 45%](structuralHole.png)![:scale 45%](ModularNetwork.png)]

## When holes are bridged: The small world concept

Small world networks have the following three properties:  
- Most nodes are not neighbors (sparse network)  
- The mean distance between two nodes is small  
- They have high global clustering coefficient

&lt;div style="float:right"&gt;
&lt;img src="map_us.png" alt="Milgram's experiment." width=400pt/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


**Stanley Milgram's experiment:**

- 160 people in Omaha try to reach one person in Boston by mail to their acquitances
- 44 letters reached the target with six steps on average
- Short path length as evidence of small-world
- Average path length on Facebook is 4.5


---

## Measuring community structure: Q-modularity

The measure of [**modularity**](https://www.pnas.org/content/103/23/8577.short) quantifies the tendency of a network to be divided in densely connected subgroups that are sparsely connected across groups.   
**Q-modularity** measures this tendency:

`$$Q = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{u,v} [ A_{u,v} - \frac{k_u k_v}{2m} ]\delta(c_u, c_v)$$`
- `\(u\)` and `\(v\)` are two nodes of the network. The sum goes over all pairs of nodes.
- `\(m\)` is the number of edges  
- `\(A\)` is the adjacency matrix ($A_{u,v} = 1$ if and only if u and v are connected)  
- `\(k_u\)` and `\(k_v\)` are the degrees of `\(u\)` and `\(v\)`  
- `\(c_u\)` is the community of `\(u\)` and `\(c_v\)` is the community of `\(v\)`  
- `\(δ(c_u,c_v)\)` takes value `\(1\)` if and only if u and v are in the same community, otherwise it's `\(0\)`

# Assortativity

.center[![:scale 30%](highDegreeAssortativity.png)  ![:scale 35%](https://dgarcia.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/supports-660x661.png)]

&gt; **Assortativity:** A network property by which similar nodes are more likely to be connected than dissimilar nodes

---

# Measuring Assortativity

Similarity is based on some node property, e.g. degree, age, political orientation, gender... 
Can be measured with the **assortativity coefficient**:

`\begin{equation*}
r=\frac{\sum_c e_{cc}-\sum_c a_c b_c}{1-\sum_c a_c b_c}
\end{equation*}`

- `\(c\)` are the classes of nodes
- `\(e_{cd}\)` is the **fraction of all edges** connecting nodes of class `\(c\)` with nodes of class `\(d\)`
- `\(e_{cc}\)` is the fraction of all edges connecting two nodes of class `\(c\)`
- `\(a_c=\sum_d e_{cd}\)`, and `\(b_c=\sum_d e_{dc}\)` (endpoint class fractions)

## Homophily

![:scale 33%](homophilyToyExample2.png) ![:scale 33%](contagionToyExample.png) ![:scale 30%](confounds.png)

&gt; **Homophily:** Phenomenon in which people are more likely to create social links to similar than to dissimilar people

## Social Contagion

![:scale 33%](homophilyToyExample2.png) ![:scale 33%](contagionToyExample.png) ![:scale 30%](confounds.png)

&gt; **Social contagion:** Phenomenon in which people tend to adopt behaviors of their social contacts

---

## Confounding

![:scale 33%](homophilyToyExample2.png) ![:scale 33%](contagionToyExample.png) ![:scale 30%](confounds.png)

&gt; **Confounding:** External effects can produce both link creation and node attributes (independent of the network topology)

# Null models

Once we have measured something or got a statistical result from our analysis, we might ask ourselves: What is the probability that this result can appear due to chance alone? 

![](Coins.png)

- If the coin is fair: P(H) = 1/2 and P(HHHHH) = 1/32
- In the case of getting five heads, how plausible is that the coin is fair?

---

# Permutation tests

- Example: correlation coefficient between two variables `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)`: `\(\rho(X,Y)\)`
- What is the probability that we could measure a similar or even stronger correlation if `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)` were completely independent?
- We can answer this questions with a permutation test 
- A permutation test has four components:

1. A **test statistic**,  e.g. `\(\rho(X,Y)\)`
2. A **null hypothesis**, which is a statement about the value of our test statistic when "nothing interesting happens". 
  - It is often denoted as `\(H_0\)` and in this case it would be `\(H_0: \rho(X,Y)=0\)`.

---
# Permutation tests

2. A **null hypothesis**, which is a statement about the value of our test statistic when "nothing interesting happens". 
  - It is often denoted as `\(H_0\)` and in this case it would be `\(H_0: \rho(X,Y)=0\)`.
3. An **alternative hypothesis**, which is another statement about the value of the test statistic that stems from our theory or research question. It is often denoted as `\(H_1\)` and, for example, it could be `\(H_1: \rho(X,Y)&gt;0\)`. 
  - The alternative hypothesis and the null hypothesis have to be contradictory. Both can't be true at the same time, but both could be false.
4. A **permutation set** with `\(N\)` random permutations or shuffles of the data. Permutations in this set model a world in which the null hypothesis is true and any measurement different than the one specified in the null hypothesis is due to chance alone.

# The p-value of a permutation test

The p-value is a way to summarize the results of a permutation test. 

&gt; **p-value:** Given that the null hypothesis is true, the p-value is the probability that we measure a statistic at least as extreme as the observed result

- **A common misconception is that the p-value measures the probability that the null hypothesis is true**. 

- The p-value measures the plausibility of what we measure under the null hypothesis, which is very different. 
---

# Calculating a p-value 

- *one-sided p-value*: proportion of permutations with a value of the statistic at least as large as the observed one. 
- *two-sided p-value*: proportion of permutations with an absolute value of the statistic at least as large as the observed one.


We can calculate the one-sided p-value from the permutation test:

```r
p_value_Cor = (sum(corPerm&gt;=corObserved)+1)/length(corPerm)
```
 
- We add one to the numerator to ensure we don't say zero
- The result is "significant" (p&lt;0.05), but careful interpreting that word!
- How many times to permute: `\(10000\)` times is safe for (p&lt;0.05)
